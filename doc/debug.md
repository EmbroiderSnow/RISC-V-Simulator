# debug

The **debug** feature is designed to closely align with the behavior of **GDB**.
 As anyone who has worked on the **ICS Shell Lab** would know, the debugging functionality is implemented within a **REPL-style framework**.
 All the commands have been implemented according to the documentation requirements, and you can try them out yourself to see how the debugger performs in action.
